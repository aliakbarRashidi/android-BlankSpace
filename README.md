## Download
#### Gradle
```java
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.battleent:BlankSpace:1.0.3'
}
```

## What is BlankSpace?
We always write too many XML codes just showing "no-result" or "try to reconnect" screens.<br>
Then we can't avoid two section screen(main is visible, no-result is gone) in xml.<br>
That makes we sometimes little confused.

In below case we will get confused because it's not intuitive.</br></br>

## Usage

### BlankSpace
```java
blankSpace = new BlankSpace(getBaseContext(), R.layout.layout_no_comment);
RelativeLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.mainlayout);
blankSpace.show(layout);
```

### BlankSpacePopup
You can use just like a popup.

```java
blankSpacePopup = new BlankSpacePopup(getBaseContext(), R.layout.layout_not_found);
blankSpacePopup.setLifecycleOwner(this);
blankSpacePopup.setAnimation(BlankSpaceAnimation.FADE_IN);

@Override
public void onClick(View view) {
    View layout = findViewById(R.id.mainlayout);
    blankSpacePopup.show(layout, 0, 20); // layout, xOff, yOff
}
```

#### Avoid memory leak issue
Dialog, PopupWindow and etc.. have memory leak issue if not dismissed before activity or fragment are destroyed.<br>
But Lifecycles are now also integrated with the Support Library since Architecture Components 1.0 Stable released.<br>
So you can solve memory leak issue so easily.
```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements LifecycleOwner {
--- skip ---
blankSpace.setLifecycleOwner(this);
```
when MainActivity destroyed, BlankSpace destroyed too.
